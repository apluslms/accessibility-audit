      <description>As a web application, A+ depends on forms to take user input for a range of purposes. The following forms were examined in the tests carried out:
 Log in (local users) Edit profile Create a group Submit an exercise requiring textual input Submit an exercise requiring a file upload  Requirements The following relevant requirements from WCAG were examined:
   1.1.1 Non-text Content (level A):      1.</description>

      <description>Requirements One key requirement is that names, roles and values can be determined programmatically. The roles are most often deduced from HTML elements (so, for example, a &amp;lt;button&amp;gt; tag can safely be assumed to be a &amp;ldquo;button&amp;rdquo;).
   4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (level A):    In several places, A+ used buttons and links in a different way to the expectation.
Users typically expect that clicking a link takes the user to another page, and clicking a button performs an action.</description>

      <title>Semantic Markup and Sequences</title>

      <description>Semantic markup When users of screen readers navigate pages, some may rely on the structure of the document to move around. This may mean taking an &amp;ldquo;outline&amp;rdquo;, made up of the nested headings, or using landmarks, such as nav and main to jump around the web page.
Luckily, these often don&amp;rsquo;t need defining explicitly, as many native HTML5 elements have an implied role. In some places, these could be easily swapped into the layout.</description>
