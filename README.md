This repository contains the audit report for the Accessibility Audit of A+, which started in Summer 2020.

The files in `/docs` are ready-to-serve, and can be hosted by GitHub Pages with no additional work.

This is a Hugo site, based on [Cupper](https://thepaciellogroup.github.io/cupper/), from [the Paciello Group](https://www.paciellogroup.com/). A `docker-compose.yml` file is included for quickly serving the site for development purposes, and the final files can be written to the `/docs` directory using `docker-compose run server "build"`.
